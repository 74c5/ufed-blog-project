Dev Day: 6

## What got done?

First hour of this AM spent catching up on page posts (Informal documentation.)
This is turning more into a Dev Diary, than a how to or actual documentation.

Couple of hours on working on main page - started on post template page.

Evening was spent on Udacity coursework for next module.

## How do I feel?

A good session this AM. But tired, don't think tommorrow is going to be especially productive.

## What am I keen to crack on with?

- Completing the template
- Tidying up... the css is looking a bit spaghetti.
- Colours need work - it still looks very ugly.
