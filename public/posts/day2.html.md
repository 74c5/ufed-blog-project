## What got done?

Basic colour scheme chosen - see [Paleton](http://paletton.com/#uid=43m0b0kw0w0jyC+oRxVy4oIDfjr) 
- although this is like to change or be tweaked as I play with the site.

Project Rubric reviewed, think I have a pretty good grasp of what is required.

Not much progress today... the mobile main page mock-up is started.
But it's Friday, beer and pizza night.


## How do I feel?

A little lacklustre, yesterday was a long day. At least I have the weekend ahead.

## What am I keen to crack on with?
Finishing the main page mockup.
