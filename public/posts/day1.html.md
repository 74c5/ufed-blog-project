So this is the first day of the journey. See todo: [about] for more information on what that is.

I suppose, I should begin with the reasons behind this blog? We'll in short, I needed content to flesh out my project design. I figured an informal documentation of my progress would suite just as well as anything. Also the 'meta-ness' of blogging about designing a blog also tickles me a bit.

So what did I achieve on day one?
* I got most of my tools set up. Perhaps there will be a post or page about those in the future.
* My first commit - basic project structure is in place, but this will undoubtedly change.
* I'm starting to get a handle on Inkscape again for mockups - why that? Well, I've used it before and it's simpler to use than gimp... I might have a quick play with LibreOffice draw but I'm not hopeful. But I really don't have time to learn something else completely new.
* Reviewing the project specifications. I still want to go over the rubric one more time. Put that on my todo for tomorrow. *Tip*: I keep a markup todo list in my root directory for next actions on projects. It looks a bit like [this](../assets/todos_day1.png)

How do I feel?
* Optimistic, I'm hoping this will not take too much time. I just need to remember to 'faff' less and knock things off my todo list.
* I'm enjoying VS Code... think I've forgotten most of the Atom short-cuts that I use to know.

What I'd like to see done next:
* I'd like to get mobile mockups done and start fleshing out the basic structure of the pages.
