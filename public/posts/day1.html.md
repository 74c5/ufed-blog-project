Day 1: The Journey Begins

See todo: [about] for more information on 'what' is exactly going on - I'm not going to go into that here.

I suppose, I should begin with the reasons behind this blog? 

Pragmatically, I needed content to flesh out my project design. I figured an informal documentation of my progress would suite just as well as anything and has the added benefit of providing some sort of documentation (record for personal use). Also, I'm tickled by the 'meta-ness' of blogging about designing a blog. If you don't get it, that's also fine.

So what did I get done on day one?
* I got most of my tools set up. Perhaps there will be a post or page about those in the future.
* My first commit - basic project structure is in place, but this will undoubtedly change.
* I'm starting to get a handle on Inkscape again for mockups - why that? Well, I've used it before and it's simpler to use than gimp... I might have a quick play with LibreOffice draw but I'm not hopeful. But I really don't have time to learn something else completely new.
* Reviewing the project specifications. I still want to go over the rubric one more time. Put that on my todo for tomorrow. *Tip*: I keep a markup todo list in my root directory for next actions on projects. It looks a bit like [this](../assets/todos_day1.png)

How do I feel?
* Optimistic, I'm hoping I won't waste too much time on minutia and meta-work. Guess I just need to remember to 'faff' less and knock things off my todo list.
* I'm enjoying VS Code... think I've forgotten most of the Atom short-cuts that I use to know.

What am I keen to get cracking on?
* Mobile mockups, so I can start to flesh out the basic structure of the pages.
