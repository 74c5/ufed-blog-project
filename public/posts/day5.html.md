## What got done?

Finally, got the cards to a point where I am happy with the layout.
There is still some tidying and refactoring to do, but I could get stuck doing 
all of that for days.

[html mock-up with cards](../assets/post-images/day5-cards.png)

I didn't feel like working on site any more after working out how to get text in
card summary to overflow correctly (tip: use [text-columns]() property). 

So, I tried another approach and hit up the course work for the next module.
It's mostly revision (in terms of knowledge, if not practice for me), so it was
a lot less effort to watch videos for an hour. It felt like I got something done,
even though it was easy (easier).

## How do I feel?

Okay... a little worried that I'm behind. But I have Friday to catch up - Bank Holiday.
I just need to build some momentum now.

## What am I keen to crack on with?
- more site layout design - blog posts
- cosmetic touches
    - getting image previews to work
    - applying some sort of coherent colour scheme
    - fonts and icons
