## What got done?

- mock-up of mobile page complete (note: colour scheme is not applied to mock-up).
- rough html/css outline of main mobile page

I am struggling with grid layouts on cards which show an outline of posts.

Also, lots of procrastination this weekend. I'm definitely not feeling it.

## How do I feel?

Trying not to beat myself up to much. I did get a few chores done around the house
and got a few personal admin things sorted - so not completely wasted time.
But I do need a little more practice with discipline and maybe an alternative strategy
for dealing with I just don't feel like it.

## What am I keen to crack on with?
Want to finish the mobile mock up (ASAP) so that I can move on.
