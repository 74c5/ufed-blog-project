## What got done?

Not as much time today - woke late. But a solid 45mins this AM and 1 hour tonight.

It feels like I got more done. Maybe it's just things coming together more.

First cut at pages done (even added an about page). They're all linked up.
Even have a little feature list with mini-cards all 'coded' up.

## How do I feel?

Fairly positive (about course). Looks like I'll have a little more time in coming weeks.

## What am I keen to crack on with?

A lot of cleaning and tidying, but would like to get one or two more features in.
Maybe the main page layout done, before any refactoring.
