        <h1>Attempting redirect in 10 seconds....</h1>

        <p>Project Example content hosted at :<a
                href="public/index.html">https://74c5.github.io/ufed-blog-project/public/index.html</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Reason:</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub pages requires a index.html file in the root directory of the project to work.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have <i>organised</i> my project to use a '/public' folder for files which should be
            published.
            I keep resources and design files in other sub-folders, potentially other things like a
            wiki, etc... too.
        </p>
        <p>
            This file is therefore implemented as a shim to redirect to the public site.
